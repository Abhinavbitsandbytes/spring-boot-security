This is a decent starter project of SpringBoot

Basic Get, Post, methods will be implemented


1 - get - http://localhost:8080/posts

2 - post - http://localhost:8080/posts
payload - {
              "title": "This is title 2",
              "description": "This is description 2"
          }

3 - get - http://localhost:8080/posts/1
response - {
               "id": 1,
               "title": "This is title 2",
               "description": "This is description 2"
           }

4  - get - http://localhost:8080/posts/8

{
    "error": "post Not found with id10",
    "statusCode": "404 NOT_FOUND",
    "timeStamp": "2026-01-01T22:28:19.8131536"
}


in spring security, just by adding the dependency, we will be presented with a login form
this is default behavior of spring security
in real world application, we will customize it as per our requirement

we also have csrf protection enabled by default in spring security
the token is present in the hidden input field of the login form
to disable csrf protection
we can do it by overriding the configure method of WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class

this csrf token is required for post, put, delete methods
for get method, csrf token is not required
the token is passed in the request header as "X-CSRF-TOKEN"

in real world, we dont use default login form of spring security
we create our own login form and authenticate the user using authentication manager
we can also use jwt token for authentication and authorization
we can also use oauth2 for authentication and authorization
